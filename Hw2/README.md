# HW2: Recognition/Classification

## Part 1: Bag-of-Words Scene Recognition
![Description](illustrate_image/part1.png)

## Part 2: CNN Image Classification
- **Image classification – predict a label for each image**
  - **Input : RGB image**
  - **Output : classification label**

- **You need to perform image classification with the following methods:**
  - **Build and train a CNN model from scratch**
    - **torchvision.models, pretrained weights is NOT allowed.**
  - **Try ResNet18 model**
    - **You can use torchvision.models.resnet18(weights=“<pretrained-model>”).**
    - **You may have to modify the structure to pass the strong baseline.**
