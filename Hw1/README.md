# HW1: Scale Invariant Feature Detection and Image Filtering

## Part 1: Scale Invariant Feature Detection
- **Implement Difference of Gaussian (DoG)**  
  Implement a scale-invariant feature detection algorithm using the Difference of Gaussian (DoG) method. This technique identifies key points that remain consistent across different scales.

## Part 2: Image Filtering
- **Advanced Color-to-Gray Conversion**  
  Enhance the color-to-gray conversion process by exploring more advanced techniques, including weighted averages and perceptually accurate color models.
  
- **Implement Bilateral Filter**  
  Implement a bilateral filter to reduce image noise while preserving edges. This filter is based on both spatial distance and pixel intensity similarity, making it effective for edge-preserving smoothing.
